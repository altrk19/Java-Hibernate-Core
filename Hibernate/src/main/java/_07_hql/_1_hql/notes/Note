An HQL INSERT cannot be used to directly insert arbitrary entitiesâ€”it can only be used to insert entities constructed
from information obtained from SELECT queries (unlike ordinary SQL, in which an INSERT command can be used to insert
arbitrary data into a table, as well as insert values selected from other tables).
